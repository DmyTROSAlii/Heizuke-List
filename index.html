                      Fate/strange fake centers around a Grail War that is
                      copied incompletely from the Third Holy Grail War in
                      Fuyuki City. After the end of the war, an organization in
                      the U.S. began collecting data from the war to be able to
                      plan their own ritual. After 70 years of preparations,
                      they choose the city of Snowfield to be the battleground
                      of their Grail War. However, during the ritual some
                      aspects of the previous war weren’t successfully copied,
                      resulting in an imitation of the Holy Grail War without a
                      Saber class and with strange Servants being summoned.

                  One of the most expansive franchises, taking ideas from
                  mythology, history, and philosophy and spinning them into an
                  explosive plot about the Holy Grail War, Fate/Zero is the best
                  place to start if you want deep drama, moral dilemmas, and
                  directorial-level fights. Here, every character has their own
                  ideology, goals, and no one is completely good or evil - just
                  different paths to the goal.

                  It's a chess game set in the backdrop of a revolution. Code
                  Geass is a combination of strategic action, socio-political
                  subtext, and a charismatic protagonist, Lelouch, who, despite
                  his harsh methods, evokes empathy. The plot is dynamic, with

                  SAO is a cult franchise that has become an icon of anime about
                  virtual worlds. The idea of ​​"how to survive in a game where
                  death is real" is implemented brilliantly. The first season is
                  a mix of adventure, romance and drama in a dynamic setting.
                  Kirito, although criticized for "overpowering", still leads
                  the story in an interesting way.

                  One of the most underrated dramas of recent years. It's not
                  just about war - it's about discrimination, loss of humanity
                  and trying to find meaning in a world that has written you
                  off. Visually - flawless, plot - poignant and deep. The
                  dialogues between Lena and Shin are especially impressive,
                  gradually opening the gap between the system and the
                  individual.

                  There's no constant dynamics or hard action here - instead,
                  there's a meditative journey and reflections on what remains
                  after great achievements. Freeren is an elf who has outlived
                  her friends and now wants to better understand what it means

                  The best anime of all time according to ratings — and this is
                  not an exaggeration. The plot is built perfectly: alchemy as a
                  metaphor for life, the Elric brothers as the embodiment of the
                  search for truth, and politics, religion, science and ethics
                  are woven into a complex, but understandable mosaic. The
                  themes of guilt, self-sacrifice and willpower here are the
                  core of everything.

                  This anime is like a guillotine: sharp, precise, and leaves a
                  shiver in its wake. It starts as a survival story in a world
                  of giants, but very quickly reveals themes of power, memory,
                  propaganda, and cycles of violence. The protagonist, Eren, is
                  one of the most complex characters, undergoing a profound
                  transformation.
